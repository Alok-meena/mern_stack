//NOW TO USE REACT BOOTSTRAP INSTALL 2 THINGS
//npm install bootstrap react-bootstrap
//and index.js me ye import kiya hai / app.js me bhi kr skte the import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
//jb npm install kiya to bs un node modules me se css ko import kiya hai

//Bootstrap relies on jQuery for its JavaScript components, which can be unnecessary overhead in a React project. 
//React-Bootstrap eliminates the need for jQuery, aligning with modern JavaScript practices and ensuring a lighter, more efficient application.
