ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. In the context of a relational database, an ORM allows developers to interact with the database using the object-oriented paradigm of their programming language rather than writing raw SQL queries.

Key Features of ORM
Mapping: ORMs map database tables to classes and table rows to objects. Each class attribute corresponds to a column in the database table.
CRUD Operations: ORMs provide methods to create, read, update, and delete records without writing SQL.
Relationships: ORMs handle relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) using object references.
Migration: Many ORMs offer migration tools to manage database schema changes in a version-controlled way.
Abstraction: ORMs abstract the database-specific details, allowing developers to write database-agnostic code.
  
Advantages of Using ORM
Productivity: ORMs can significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to perform database operations.
Maintainability: Code is generally easier to read and maintain when using ORMs.
Security: ORMs help protect against SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries.
Portability: Code written using an ORM can be more easily adapted to work with different databases.

  
Disadvantages of Using ORM
Performance: ORMs can introduce performance overhead, especially for complex queries. Fine-tuning SQL might be necessary for performance-critical parts of the application.
Learning Curve: Developers need to learn the ORM's API and how it maps to SQL concepts.
Abstraction Leaks: Not all database-specific features may be supported by the ORM, leading to situations where raw SQL is still necessary.
  
Examples of ORMs
JavaScript/Node.js: Sequelize, TypeORM
Python: SQLAlchemy, Django ORM
Ruby: ActiveRecord (Rails)
Java: Hibernate
C#: Entity Framework
Example with Sequelize (JavaScript/Node.js)
Here's a simple example using Sequelize to define a model and perform basic CRUD operations:

Installation:

bash
Copy code
npm install sequelize mysql2
Database Connection:

javascript
Copy code
const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
    host: 'localhost',
    dialect: 'mysql'
});

sequelize.authenticate()
    .then(() => console.log('Connection has been established successfully.'))
    .catch(err => console.error('Unable to connect to the database:', err));
Model Definition:

javascript
Copy code
const User = sequelize.define('User', {
    username: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        allowNull: false
    },
    email: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        allowNull: false,
        unique: true
    }
}, {
    timestamps: true
});
Sync Database and Perform CRUD Operations:

javascript
Copy code
sequelize.sync({ force: true })
    .then(() => {
        // Create a new user
        return User.create({
            username: 'johndoe',
            email: 'johndoe@example.com'
        });
    })
    .then(user => {
        console.log(user.toJSON());

        // Find a user
        return User.findOne({ where: { username: 'johndoe' } });
    })
    .then(user => {
        console.log(user.toJSON());

        // Update a user
        return user.update({ email: 'john.doe@example.com' });
    })
    .then(user => {
        console.log(user.toJSON());

        // Delete a user
        return user.destroy();
    })
    .then(() => {
        console.log('User deleted');
    })
    .catch(err => console.error(err));


In this example, Sequelize is used to define a User model, sync the model with the database, and perform basic CRUD operations without writing raw SQL. This demonstrates how ORMs can simplify database interactions in an application.

THIS IS WHY WE ARE USING ORM
